## Collection of notes on how to approach the world

- ideas from Canvas for Thinking could be applied to programming
  - laying out functions spatially
  - laying out (embodied data) spatially
    - or maybe a Data Layer that can be toggled on/off
  - mixing code, visual reference materials, running instances, and data in the same space (I explored some of these ideas in Protoboard)

- VPLs, understood as "nodes-and-wires", usually provide some sort of infinite canvas to lay functions on, I'm curious if this combination is necessary - can the code still be text (or some other structural approach), while I can still "keep some functions here on the right of that other thing" - basically thinking spatially about my code

notable work in this direction is Dark ↗ (also featuring the "embodied data" idea):

You have a gun pointed at you, from inside your head. When you lack energy, when failure hurts and risks are scary, and when life is heavy, it’s the gun.
